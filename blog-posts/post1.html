        <p>How do”you spot a leader? According to Robert Townsend,
            they come in all sizes, ages, shapes, and conditions. Some are poor
            administrators, while some are not overly bright. There is a clue:
            Since some people are mediocre, the true leader can be recognized
            because somehow his people consistently demonstrate superior
            performances. 
            A leader is great, not because of his or her power, but because
            of his or her ability to empower others. Success without a successor
            is failure. A worker’s main responsibility is doing the work himself.
            A leader’s main responsibility is developing others to do the work
            (see chapter 7).
            Loyalty to the leader reaches its highest peak when the follower
            has personally grown through the mentorship of the leader. Note
            the progression: At level 2, the follower loves the leader; at level 3,
            the follower admires the leader; at level 4, the follower is loyal to
            the leader. Why? You win people’s hearts by helping them grow
            personally.

            One of the key players on my staff is Sheryl Fleisher. When she first joined the team she was not a people person. I began to work
            closely with her until she truly became a people person. Today she
            successfully develops others. There is a bond of loyalty that Sheryl
            gives to my leadership, and we both know the reason. My time
            invested with her brought a positive change. She will never forget
            what I have done for her. Interestingly her time invested in the
            lives of others has greatly helped me. I will never forget what she
            has done for me, either. 
            The core of leaders who surround you should all be people you
            have personally touched or helped to develop in some way. When
            that happens, love and loyalty will be exhibited by those closest to
            you and by those who are touched by your key leaders.

            There is, however, a potential problem of moving up the levels
            of influence as a leader and becoming comfortable with the group
            of people you have developed around you. You may not realize
            that many new people view you as a “position” leader because you
            have had no contact with them.
